    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <div class="firstlist">
      <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>
          Css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,
          or in other media.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span id="cancel">Css is not necessary</span
          ><span class="mark">CSS saves alot of work.</span
          ><span>It control the layout of multiple web pages all at</span>
        </li>
        <li id="ul">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div class="secondlist">
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External - by using alink element to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in the external
          CSS files. However,
          <span class="mark">
            in this tutorial we will use inline nad internal styles,
          </span>
          because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
          yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies
        a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand, applies a style to
        one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL
        tolink directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, selectorsareused to target a specific element or range of
        elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or
        set of style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
        used are class ad ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
        should be applied.
